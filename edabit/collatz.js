// COLLATZ CONJECTURE

// The Collatz conjecture in mathematics asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1.
//
// It works like this:
//
// - Start with any positive number
// - If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1
// - If the number is even, divide it by 2
// - Repeat the above process on the resulting number
//
// The Collatz conjecture has shown that any positive number
// will eventually reach 1, which will result in a loop where
// no further progress can be made
//
// Use Javascript to test the Collatz conjecture:
//
// Write a function that takes in a number, and run the collatz operation on every number from 1 to the number received as a parameter.
//
// Include code that finds which number took the most amount of steps to reach 1, and how many steps it took.
//
// Include code that finds which number that reached the highest number in its sequence, and what that peak value was.
//
// Output the following console.log from your function:
//
// “Running the Collatz procedure on all numbers from 1 to (number received):”
//
// “The integer with most steps was (number), with (number of steps) total steps”
//
// “The integer with the highest peak was (number), with a peak of (highest peak value)”
